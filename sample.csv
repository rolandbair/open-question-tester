"What is object-oriented programming?","1. Definition of OOP
2. Key principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism)
3. Real-world examples","Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It is based on key principles like encapsulation (bundling data and methods), inheritance (creating new classes from existing ones), and polymorphism (handling objects differently based on their class).","Object-oriented programming is a way to write code using objects. Objects contain data and can do actions. You can also make new objects based on existing ones."
"Explain the concept of recursion.","1. Clear definition
2. Base case explanation
3. Example of recursive problem","Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems. Each recursive call must have a base case that stops the recursion. For example, calculating factorial: n! = n * (n-1)!","Recursion is when a function calls itself. It's like a loop that keeps going until it reaches the end. For example, you can use it to calculate factorials."
